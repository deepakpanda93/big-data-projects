# This is an example flume application

# Source - netcat
# Sink - logger
# Channel - memory
# 
# The source and sink are netcat and logger. netcat can simulate a webserver for testing
# Once the flume command is run as part of run_flume.sh, open another terminal window and type the following command

telnet localhost 44444

Once this telnet session opens, the text we type here are sent to the flume and then displayed

This is displayed in the terminal as we use the logger as sink
