# This is an example flume application

# Source - exec
# Sink - hdfs
# Channel - memory

The exec source is used to run some commands on the source especially webserver logs to get the logs into the flume. 

The hdfs sink is for storing the data in HDFS under the path that is configured

The channel is once again memory.

Once run_flume.sh is run, it tails the logs from the webserver and writes to a file in HDFS based on the path and other configurations in the .conf file
